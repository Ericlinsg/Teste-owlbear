GitHub Copilot here. I can see you have a combat system script for Owlbear Rodeo. What would you like me to help you modify? 

For example, I can help you:
- Add new features (healing, status effects, etc.)
- Fix bugs or improve the dice rolling logic
- Refactor code for better organization
- Add validation or error handling
- Improve the UI panels

What change would you like to make?
